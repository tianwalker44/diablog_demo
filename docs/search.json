Determining the role of resources in making like with diabetes more manageable, \n<br>3. Assessing the relationship that self adjusting diabetes medication (insulin) has with diabetes outcomes (inclduing mental and physical health as well as blood sugar), and\n<br>4. Exploring what factors are associated with the highest levels of wellbeing among people living with type 1 diabetes",

Research studies are done to make sure that people understand what each question is asking as closely as possible and that no two questions are too similar.\nPros: we can count on them more and expect more accurate results\nCons: they take a long time to develop and sometimes we want to ask questions about things that no one has developed a validated scale for yet. Also, sometimes the questions become outdated.\nWhat is a researcher-created question?\nA researcher-created question refers to a question written for the first time by a researcher. The researcher looks for validated scales on the topic of interest and if none exist, they write their own question. Often times the researcher asks people in the community to test the questions and provide feedback about them.\nPros: questions can be written about anything, can capture the most current state of the subject of the questions, and can bring new types of information into the research world\nCons: people might interpret the question differently from one another, the wording of the question might not be perfect, and the excpectations of the accuracy in the responses is lower\nClick here for a deep dive into research findings:\nhttps://tianwalker44.github.io/diabetes_dashboard/\nValidated Scales were used for:\nDiabetes Empowerment\nDiabetes Distress\nHealth Engagement\nDepression\nAnxiety\nOverall Health\nDiabetes Knowledge\nResarcher created questions were used for:\nSelf-adjustment of insulin\nExperiences of feeling symptoms\nUse of resources\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\n\n\nType 1 Diabetes is a disease that requires vigilant monitoring and constant medication to make up for the pancreasâ€™s lack of ability to produce insulin (a hormone vital to digeting food and turning it into energy).\nPeople with type 1 Diabetes must take insulin to live, but if they take too much insulin it results in immediate death.\nConstant glucose monitors are a small, wearable machine that allows us to see blood sugar values every 5 minutes. This allows people with type 1 diabetes to aim for blood sugar within a tight range, but it also induces an intense amount of stress and anxiety.\nIf blood sugar stays high for too long, it slowly damages organs and causes blindness, amputations, and death. However, if it goes too low it results in seizures, comas, or death.\nThere are also values of blood sugar that are higher or lower than what we would see in a healthy body that are not high enough or low enough to be directly life-threatening but they can cause unpleasant symptoms. This study explores those symptoms. There are many components of t1d that are not life-threatening that are still largely impactful and deserve the focus of resarch.\n\n\n\n",
